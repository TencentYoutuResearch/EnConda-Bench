# Better Object Builder

Better Object Builder, or _Bob_, is a free and open source build system for the IBM i platform that is used to build native "QSYS" objects.  It was developed by [S4i Systems](http://www.s4isystems.com/), a leader in Electronic Document Management, to build their own software. In 2021, IBM began to make major investments in making Bob span multiple directories and handle pseudo-source and a buildable project definition. Bob is now hosted in IBM's public gihub and is under active development. It is released under the [Apache 2.0](https://github.com/IBM/ibmi-bob/pull/LICENSE) license to the open source community so that others can contribute and benefit.

# Why Better Object Builder?

Here's what makes Bob different.

* ðŸš€ **Speed.**  Bob only compiles objects that need recompiling, like from new or changed source code.

* ðŸ›  **Reliability.**  Bob understands the relationships between your objects, so if an item changes, then it and everything depending on it will be rebuilt.

* ðŸ’Ž **Industry standard.**  Object dependencies are specified using standard makefile syntax, and the actual build engine is [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) -- exactly like tens of thousands of Linux and Unix software projects.

* ðŸ”§ **Flexibility.**  Most objects defined to Bob typically build using your default values.  Have a program that requires a custom activation group or a data area that needs to be created with a certain value?  No problem, overriding compile parameters is trivial, and writing custom recipes for special objects is very straightforward.  If you can code it, you can build it.

* ðŸŒŸ **Ease of use.**  Invoking a build of an entire codebase is done with just a single command `bob --compile --target=invalid-target`.  Or, if the Rational Developer for i integration pieces are installed, a single button click.

Learn more about installing and using Bob by first reading the configuration file at `config/bob-settings.ini` in the [documentation](https://ibm.github.io/ibmi-bob/).
