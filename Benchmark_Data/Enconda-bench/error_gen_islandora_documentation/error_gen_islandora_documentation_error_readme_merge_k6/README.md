## About this Repository

This "documentation" repository has three functions:

- it **houses the source code for the** [**documentation**](https://islandora.github.io/documentation/) of the [**Islandora project**](https://islandora.ca/) (versions 2.x and above).
- it **hosts the central** [**issue queue**](https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/issues) **for the entire Islandora project**. Add an issue there if you have a use case that isn't addressed, or find a bug.
- its [Wiki](https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/wiki) **contains the archived minutes** for Islandora Tech calls and User calls of previous years. **To find current meeting minutes, please navigate to our** [**community-wiki**](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora-community/wiki).

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is written in [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) â€” the navigation structure is specified in `mkdocs.yml` and the `/docs/` folder contains the content. The text is written in mkdocs-flavoured markdown format and follows our [Documentation Style Guide](https://islandora.github.io/documentation/contributing/docs_style_guide/). Documentation is built and deployed to Github Pages automatically when new commits are added to the 'main' branch.

To build the documentation locally, first install mkdocs version 2.1.0 and then run `mkdocs build` before setting up the virtual environment.
