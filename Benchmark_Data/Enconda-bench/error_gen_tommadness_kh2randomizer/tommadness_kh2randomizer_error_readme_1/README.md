## Setup

To get started, install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, create and activate a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Usage

To generate a randomized seed, run the main script with a path to your seed configuration file:

```bash
python randomizer.py --seed-file myseed.json
```
